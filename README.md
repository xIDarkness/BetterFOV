# BetterFOV

BetterFOV is a modification based on Forge for the Minecraft version 1.8.9.

It provides the functionality to set a new upper limit to the Field Of View value (FOV) of the game. Minecraft only allows a value of up to 110 (Quake Pro) out of the box.

The new maximum value is 150, but can be changed. To do so, open the configuration file `%appdata%/.minecraft/config/betterfov.cfg` and edit `max-value`.

In addition, there is now the command `/fov <value>`, which allows you to adjust the FOV value as desired.
